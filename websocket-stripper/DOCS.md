# WebSocket Stripper

Serves your real Home Assistant dashboards but only forwards the entities each dashboard
uses, so kiosk/wall-panel pages load fast on large instances — with no loss of fidelity
(it's the real frontend and real cards).

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `dashboards` | list of strings | Dashboard `url_path`s to serve (e.g. `fridge-status`). The forwarded entity set is the **union** of all of them, so you can navigate between them. Find a dashboard's `url_path` in Settings → Dashboards. |
| `always_forward` | list | Entities to forward even if no listed dashboard uses them. Each item is a literal `entity_id` or a `/regex/` (matched against all entities). |
| `never_forward` | list | Entities to never forward. Applied last — **wins** over `always_forward` and dashboard detection. Literal or `/regex/`. |
| `strip_entities` | bool | `true` (default) strips the websocket to the allowlist. `false` = full passthrough (for A/B comparison). |
| `port` | int | Port the add-on listens on (default `8099`). Because it runs with `host_network: true`, this option is how you move it off `8099` — the **Network** tab can't remap a host-network port. Change it if `8099` collides with another add-on (e.g. Zigbee2MQTT). |
| `ha_base` | string | Optional. Override the Home Assistant base URL the add-on proxies to (default `http://homeassistant:8123`). Set this if `host_network` is on and the internal `homeassistant` hostname doesn't resolve — e.g. `http://192.168.4.2:8123`. |
| `allow_ws_url` | string | Optional. Override the websocket URL used once at startup to precompute the allowlist (default `ws://supervisor/core/websocket`). Set if `supervisor` doesn't resolve under `host_network` — e.g. `ws://192.168.4.2:8123/api/websocket` (also requires a token via `ALLOW_TOKEN`). |

### Example

```yaml
dashboards:
  - fridge-status
  - home-status
  - dashboard-deck
always_forward:
  - "/^sun\\./"
  - person.gabriel
never_forward:
  - "/_battery$/"
strip_entities: true
```

Regex entries are slash-wrapped with optional flags, e.g. `"/_motion$/i"`. In YAML,
backslashes must be escaped (`"\\."`).

## Usage

After starting, browse to `http://<ha-host>:8099/<dashboard-url-path>`, e.g.
`http://homeassistant.local:8099/fridge-status`. Point your kiosk browser at that URL.

> **Port:** because this add-on runs with `host_network: true` (see the tradeoff below),
> it binds directly on the host and the **Network** tab cannot remap it. If `8099` collides
> with another add-on (e.g. Zigbee2MQTT), set the `port` option instead.

The first visit prompts a normal HA login (it's a different origin); after that it's your
real dashboard.

### Trusted-network (password-less) kiosk login

To let a kiosk skip the password via HA's `trusted_networks` auth provider, the add-on
must run with `host_network: true` (the default in this add-on). Without it, Docker
rewrites every client to the gateway IP (`172.30.32.1`) before the proxy sees it, so the
kiosk's real LAN IP never reaches HA and `trusted_networks` can't match it.

On the HA side (`configuration.yaml`), the request now arrives from the **host itself**:

```yaml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    - 127.0.0.1
    - ::1
    # add the host's own LAN IP too if the add-on reaches HA via it, e.g. 192.168.4.2
homeassistant:
  auth_providers:
    - type: trusted_networks
      trusted_networks:
        - 192.168.5.0/24      # the kiosk's subnet
      allow_bypass_login: true
    - type: homeassistant     # keep this or you lose password login entirely
```

Then `ha core restart` (a full restart — `http:` changes need it).

### Why `host_network` is on — and what it costs

This add-on ships with `host_network: true` on purpose. That single flag is a tradeoff, so
here is exactly what you get and what you give up.

**What it buys you.** The add-on shares the host's network stack instead of Docker's
bridged network, so HA sees the **browser's real LAN IP**. That is the *only* clean way to
make the trusted-network (password-less) kiosk login above work: in bridged mode Docker
NATs every client to the gateway `172.30.32.1` before the proxy sees it, so the kiosk's
real IP never reaches HA and `trusted_networks` can't match it.

**What it costs.**

- **The port is rigid.** It binds `:8099` on the host directly; the **Network** tab can't
  remap it, so a clash with another add-on on `8099` can't be fixed there (see #6 above).
- **Internal DNS can break.** The `homeassistant` and `supervisor` hostnames may not
  resolve in host-network mode. If startup fails, pin them to IPs with the `ha_base` and
  `allow_ws_url` options (e.g. `ha_base: http://192.168.4.2:8123`).
- **HA sees the request from the host itself**, so `trusted_proxies` must list
  `127.0.0.1`/`::1` (and optionally the host LAN IP) — not the Docker gateway subnet.

**If you don't need password-less-by-IP login**, none of the above helps you and bridged
mode is simpler (free port remapping, working DNS). Some users run a locally-modified copy
with `host_network: false` for exactly that reason. It is not exposed as an option because
`host_network` is a build-time add-on setting, not a runtime one — changing it means
editing `config.yaml` and rebuilding. If you log in normally (or with a token) and don't
rely on trusted-network auto-login, that's a reasonable local change; you then trim the
port via the Network tab as usual. The default stays `true` so the documented kiosk login
keeps working out of the box.

## Notes & limits

- Trimming only affects the **entity** stream (`get_states` / `subscribe_entities`).
  Registries, lovelace config, translations, and the frontend JS bundles pass through.
- Cards referencing entities outside the allowlist will show "unavailable". The allowlist
  is computed generously (all views + template-referenced ids), but if something's
  missing add it via `always_forward`.
- The allowlist is computed at **startup** — restart the add-on after changing a
  dashboard's cards.
- Navigating (via the HA sidebar) to a dashboard **not** in `dashboards` will show its
  entities as unavailable; add it to the list if you want it served too.
